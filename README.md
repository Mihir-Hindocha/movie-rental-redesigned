# book-rental-redesigned
This project is part of Object Oriented Software Engineering Class. I have to redesign the application such that it is well-organised, scalable, maintainable and can be easily understood.

The requirements of this project are that:-

1) Your new program must support different types of items including movies, video games, music CDs and books. You should support different categories of movies, music CDs, DVDs, and books. You must anticipate other new types of items as well.

2) Your new program must support not only renting, but also selling those items.

3) You should provide basic functions to support renting and selling transactions for those items in the store.
